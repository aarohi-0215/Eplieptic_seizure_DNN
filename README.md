# Eplieptic_seizure_DNN
Prediction of Epileptic seizures via Deep Neural Network on EEG datasets is a machine learning project focused on building a predictive model that can identify epileptic seizures from EEG (electroencephalogram) signals using a deep neural network (DNN). This project utilizes EEG data preprocessing, neural network training, and evaluation to distinguish between seizure and non-seizure brain activity and aims to support automated detection from raw EEG data.


Project Overview
Epileptic seizures are sudden electrical disturbances in the brain that can significantly impact quality of life. EEG signals capture brain electrical activity over time, and deep learning models can be trained to detect patterns associated with seizure events. This repository implements a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for seizure prediction, using processed EEG datasets to learn discriminative features and classify events accurately.
